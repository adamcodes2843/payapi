# Frontend Mentor - PayAPI multi-page website

## Overview
This is a frontend mentor project. It's a four page, responsive website that was built using a provided figma design. I used astro for static site generation and seo optimization, and svelte for interactive client side islands. This is my first time using both technologies, which were easy to pick up and learn, and I'm excited to continue to dive deeper into svelte and astro in future projects. I used a mobile-first workflow, and basic modular css in my components to style the page.
